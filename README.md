# Transcribe with Chirp and Cloud Functions

[![Terraform](https://github.com/kavichu/transcribe-chirp/actions/workflows/terraform.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kavichu/transcribe-chirp/actions/workflows/terraform.yml)

# Abstract
The goal of this project is to create the infrasctructure needed to generate transcriptions from audio files, to achieve this we used Terraform and Google Cloud Platform.

# Architecture

![Architecture](https://github.com/kavichu/transcribe-chirp/blob/main/images/architecture.png?raw=true)


# Setting up Google Cloud Platform
## Create a Service Account
On the search bar that is located on top of the page, write "IAM" and on the option "IAM & Admin"
![IAM](https://github.com/kavichu/transcribe-chirp/blob/main/images/google_service_account_0.jpg?raw=true)

On the left sidebar go to the menu "Service Accounts" and then click on the button "Create Service Account"

## Grant access to the Service Account

## Create a json key for the Service Account
After creating the Service Account go to its details and click on the tab "Keys" and click "Add Key" and "Create new key"
![Create Key](https://github.com/kavichu/transcribe-chirp/blob/main/images/google_create_key_0.jpg?raw=true)

Choose the option JSON and download the file, is is important to keep this file secret, it is a credential that has access to create resources inside your Google Cloud Platform account.

## Create a Storage Bucket for Terraform's backend
Terraform stores its state in a construct called "backend", in this scenario we are using Google Cloud Storage, also known as GCS.

In order to do this, we first need to create a GCS Bucket inside our account.

In the search bar, write "GCS" and click on the option "Cloud Storage".

![GCS](https://github.com/kavichu/transcribe-chirp/blob/main/images/google_create_bucket_cicd_0.jpg?raw=true)


Click on "Create", fill the name of the bucket, this name has to be unique.
![Storage Bucket](https://github.com/kavichu/transcribe-chirp/blob/main/images/google_create_bucket_cicd_1.jpg?raw=true)

After filling the name click on continue and set the Location type to "Region" and the value "us-central1"

# Setting up repository on Github
## Fork repository
Log in to your Github account, open the respository [and click on "Fork"](https://github.com/kavichu/transcribe-chirp/fork)

![Fork Respository](https://github.com/kavichu/transcribe-chirp/blob/main/images/github_setup_0.jpg?raw=true)

After creating the fork, go to the repository settings

![Fork Respository](https://github.com/kavichu/transcribe-chirp/blob/main/images/github_setup_1.jpg?raw=true)

## Create secrets
On repository settings scroll down and on the left sidebar you will find Secrets and Variables, click on "Actions" and then on "New respository secret".

The name of the secret is "GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS", the content is the service account key json file.

## Configuring Terraform variables in Github
In the current scenario we have the next Github variables that are being used inside our Terraform code.
- GCP_PROJECT: The ID of the project inside Google Cloud Platform
- GCP_REGION: The region where the cloud resources will be deployed
- GCP_APP_ENGINE_LOCATION: The location where the app is deployed
- TERRAFORM_GCS_BUCKET: The name of the bucket used as the backend for Terraform state

At the moment of this writing, the [Chirp: Universal speech model](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/v2/docs/chirp-model) is only available in us-central1 region, so we are going to use:
- GCP_REGION: "us-central1"
- GCP_APP_ENGINE_LOCATION: "us-central"

While on the "Actions secrets and variables" click on "Variables" tab and click on "New repository variable", then create each of the 4 variables.
